title: << Physical Models of Living Systems >> by Philip Nelson
---

This book introduces various classical mathematical models of biological systems. 

It is a great book if you have already been exposed to biology, statistics and modeling.

My favoriate part of is about its visulization of real data. Sometimes having those figure in memory can be quiet helpful when you see it again in one's own research.

Before I get started, here's how I feel about probabilistic modeling vs deep learning.
  
### Probabilistic modeling text books:
  
We have a problem -> and some experimental data -> We make some assumptions about the systems -> We derive a set of equations/do some simulations -> We comapre results with data to find optimal parameter -> We have a model, now make some new predictions
  
### Deep learning text books:

We have a problem -> We have some data, labeled as 0/1 -> Neural network is ready to go -> ... -> Boom! We trained a model!
