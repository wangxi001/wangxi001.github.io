title: \<\<Physical Models of Living Systems\>\> by Philip Nelson
---

A brief text and graphical summary of the book, which introduces various classical mathematical models of biological systems. This is a great book if you have already been exposed to biology, statistics and modeling.
  
Before I get started, here's how I feel about probabilistic modeling vs deep learning.
  
#### Probabilistic modeling text book:
  
We have a problem -> and some experimental data -> We make some assumptions about the systems -> We derive a set of equations/do some simulations -> We comapre results with data to find optimal parameter -> We have a model, now make some new predictions
  
#### Deep learning text book:

We have a problem -> We have some data, labeled as 0/1 -> Neural network is ready to go -> ... -> Boom! We trained a model!
