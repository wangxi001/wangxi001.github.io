title: <<Physical Models of Living Systems>> by Philip Nelson
---

A brief text and graphical summary of the book, which introduces various classical mathematical models of biological systems.
  
Before I get started, this is how I feel about probabilistic modeling vs deep learning.
  
Probabilistic modeling text book:
  
We have a problem -> We have some data -> We make some assumptions about the systems -> We derive a set of equations/do some simulations -> We comapre results with data to find optimal parameter -> We have a model, now make some new predictions
  
Deep learning text book:

We have a problem -> We have some data -> Deep learning comes in -> ... -> ... -> ... -> Boom! We have a model!
