title: Questions you want to ask at a postdoc interview
---

I finished about half of my posdoc interviews before new year 2022. Here are some thoughts about the questions one should ask to better learn if a new lab or PI is a good fit:

### Research project
1. What kind of project will I be working on?
2. Is it okay if I do only wet lab or computational work?
3. Can we come up with a safe project and a risky project?

### Lab enviroment
5. Does the lab feel supportive overall? Do people help each other on experiments and everything?
6. Does the PI support postdocs to go independent and move forward?

6. When there's a challenge, how do the student and PI work together to solve it?
7.
