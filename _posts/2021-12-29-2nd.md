title: Questions you want to ask at a postdoc interview
---

I finished about half of my posdoc interviews before new year 2022. Here are some thoughts about the questions one should ask to better learn if a new lab or PI is a good fit:

### Research project
* What kind of project will I be working on? Are they safe or risky?

* Is it okay if I do only wet lab or computational work?

* Is it easy to find good collaborators?

### Lab enviroment
* Does the lab feel supportive overall? Do people help each other on experiments and everything?

* When there's a challenge, how do the trainee and PI work together to solve it?

### Future development
* Does the PI support postdocs to go independent and move forward in a few years?

* Do people have opportunity to go to conferences and apply for fellowships?
