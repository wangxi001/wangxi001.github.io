title: Questions you want to ask at a postdoc interview
---

I finished about half of my posdoc interviews before new year 2022. Here are some thoughts about the questions one should ask to better learn if a new lab or PI is a good fit:

1. What kind of project will I be working on?
2. Does the lab feel supportive overall? 
3. Does the PI support postdocs to be independent and move forward?
4.
5. When there's a challenge, how do the student and PI work together to solve it?
6.
